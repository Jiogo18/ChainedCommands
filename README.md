# Chained Commands

This small Qt application can execute multiple commands one after another.

This is useful if you want to stack commands and add/edit/remove them on the fly.

Contrary to a script (.bat, .ps1, .sh), you can add/edit/remove a command before it is executed.
It is also possible to skip a command (terminate/kill the process) and to pause after the execution of the current command.

This project uses Qt 6.4.2 MinGW

## Examples

### Stack commands

If you need to run 10 commands quickly, you can execute them in parallel with 10 terminals.
But if each command uses 100 % of your resources, it's better to execute one by one.

You could create a script, but it means you have to write your 10 commands before starting the operation.
And if you need to modify a command, you have to stop the script...

With this application, you can write/paste the first commands, execute them and, while they are running, write the last commands.
It is also possible to execute commands before they are executed.

### 2 commands using the same port

A process is running on port 1234.
You want to stop this process and start another one on the same port 1234.
In a terminal, you would stop the command and start the other with 2â€“10 seconds without connection.
With this application, you can add the new command and run it 0.5 seconds after the previous one ended.
